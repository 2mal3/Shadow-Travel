Travel through the world with the help of the shadows!
If a player is in absolute darkness for too long, a portal to another world will open. In this shadow dimension, one block is equivalent to 16 blocks in the overworld, which makes it excellent for travelling long distances.
A single portal is not very useful, but the more portals that are opened from the overworld, the larger and more complex, and therefore more useful, the network becomes.

But be careful, if even one ray of light hits the portal in the overworld, it will be destroyed, and staying too long in the shadow dimension also has its consequences.
